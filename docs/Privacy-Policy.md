Last Updated : April 16th, 2024

Welcome! We are Rephy . This Privacy Notice explains how Rephy, Inc. (“Rephy”, “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal information (as defined below) in connection with our websites (the “Sites”) we own and operate that link to this Privacy Notice, and the related content, platform, services, products, and other functionality offered on or through our services (collectively, the “Services”). It does not address our privacy practices relating to Rephy job applicants, employees and other personnel.

I. What is Personal Information?

When we use the term “personal information” in this Privacy Notice, we mean any data or information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular natural person or household or any other data or information that constitutes “personal information,” “personal information,” or “personally identifiable information.”

II. Our Collection and Use of Personal Information

We collect personal information in a variety of ways. For example, you may provide us your personal information when you register for an account, send us messages, subscribe to our mailing lists, newsletters or other forms of marketing communications, submit a job application, participate in a survey, contest or sweepstakes, redeem a promotion, or use some other feature of our Service.

We may link or combine your activities and information collected from you on our Sites and Apps with information we receive from third parties, as well as information we collect automatically through tracking technologies (defined below). This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us.

Personal Information Collected from You

We may collect the following categories of personal information submitted to us by individuals through the Services:

- Customer Information. If you register for the Services as a “Customer,” we collect first and last name, user ID, email address, profession/role and privacy preferences. We may also collect the password to your account, unless you register using Google, as well as a profile picture from you if you choose to upload one. We use this information to fulfill your request or transaction, administer your account, provide you with the relevant service and information, communicate with you regarding your account and your use of the Service, send you marketing communications in accordance with your preferences and for customer support purposes.

- Service Provider Information. If you register for the Services as a “Service Provider,” we collect first and last name, company name, business postal address, email address, phone number, user ID, profile information, a description of services you provide, and any other information you provide to us, such as a profile picture, specialty, street address, years of experience, credentials, and additional pictures. We may also collect the password to your account, unless you register using Google. We use this information to administer your account, provide you with the relevant service and information, communicate with you regarding your account and your use of the Service and for customer support purposes. Please note we utilize a third-party provider to process payments on our behalf and do not accept payment directly through our Services.

- Payment Information. If you sign up for one of our Services requiring payment, we collect the information provided in connection with such payment. Please note that we use third-party payment processors, including Stripe, to process credit card payments made to us. As such, we do not retain any personally identifiable financial information in connection with credit card payments, such as credit card numbers. Rather, all such information is provided directly by you to our third-party processor. The payment processor’s use of your personal information is governed by their privacy notice.

We use the User Content to provide you with the Services.

- Connections, including information about the accounts and other users you interact with and have chosen to connect to. We use this information to enable you further interact and share information with and about the Customers and Services Providers in your network and to provide relevant services and information and to enhance the services we offer to our users.

- Referrals. If you choose to tell a friend about the Services or one of the Service Providers, we may collect your friend's name and email address and any information you choose to share regarding the referral. We do not use this information for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person, or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you refer a friend, your email address may be included in the message sent to your friend. If your friend connects with the Service Provider you referred, the Service Provider will receive your public profile information.

- Address Book Information. With your permission, we may access your contact list available on your mobile device or your email accounts, or you may choose to provide the contact information of others manually, so that you can send invitations or special content to your contacts. When communicating with your contacts, we may include your name and photo to let them know that you are the person extending the invitation or sending the message. With your permission, we may also send reminder emails to your contacts on your behalf, which may also include your name and photo, and enable you to send invitations to your contacts via email, SMS/text or other social channels. We may retain your contacts’ email addresses to let you know when the recipient received a communication from us.

We use this information to respond to your request, provide you the requested services, and to inform our marketing and advertising campaigns. If you choose to contact us, we may need additional information to fulfill the request or respond to your inquiry. We may provide additional privacy disclosures where the scope of the request we receive or personal information we require fall outside the scope of this Privacy Notice. In that case, the additional privacy disclosures will govern how we may process the information you provide at that time.

Personal Information from Third Parties

We also obtain personal information from third parties which we often combine with personal information we collect either automatically or directly from an individual.

We may receive the same categories of personal information as described above from the following third parties:

- Rephy Entities: We may receive personal information from other companies and brands owned or controlled by Rephy, and other companies owned by or under common ownership as Rephy. We use this information to provide our Services.

- Other Users or Individuals who Interact with our Services: We may receive your information from other users or other individuals who interact with our Services. For example, we may receive personal data (including contact information) about you when others import or sync their contacts with our Services or send messages using our Services (including invites, referrals or connection requests).

- Social Media: When you interact with our Services through various social media networks, such as when you follow or share our content on other social networks, we may receive some information about you that you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network and may include your profile picture and user ID associated with your social media account. You should always review and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and social media networks and services before sharing information and/or linking or connecting them to other services . We use this information to operate, maintain and provide to you the features and functionality of the Services, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages about products and services that may be of interest to you.

- Vendors: Our vendors that perform services solely on our behalf, such as survey and marketing providers and payment processors, collect personal information and often share some or all of this information with us. The information may include contact information, demographic information, payment information, and information about your communications and related activities. We may use this information to administer and facilitate our services and our marketing activities.

- Business Partners: We may receive your information from our business partners, such as companies that offer their products and/or services on our Services. We may use this information to administer and facilitate our services and our marketing activities.

- Information We Receive from Authentication Services You Connect to our Services: Some parts of our Services may allow you to log-in through a third-party social network or authentication service such as Google. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us, which could include your email address, profile picture, address book and contacts, or other information. The data we receive is dependent on that third party’s policies and your privacy settings on that third-party site. We use this information to operate, maintain and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also send you service-related emails or messages (e.g., account verification, purchase confirmation, customer support, changes or updates to features of the Site, technical and security notices).
  We may offer Face ID, Touch ID or fingerprint authentication as a log-in method if you access the Service through an Apple or Android device equipped with authentication technology. We are only notified as to whether the authentication was successful, and we cannot access the data associated with the enrolled fingerprint. For more details, please refer to the fingerprint security guides offered by your device provider.

- Other Sources: We may also collect personal information about individuals that we do not otherwise have from, for example, publicly available sources, third-party data providers, brand partnerships, or through transactions such as mergers and acquisitions. We use this information to operate, maintain and provide to you the features and functionality of the Services, as well as to communicate directly with you, such as to send you email messages about products and services that may be of interest to you.

Through the provision of our Services, we may also process deidentified information that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular consumer or household. Rephy commits to maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information, except in instances where necessary for determining whether the deidentification process used by Rephy satisfies the requirements under applicable law.

Additional Limits on the Use of Your Google Information

Our Services use certain Google services, such as the Google Gmail API. You can connect your Gmail account using OAuth authentication, a secure mechanism to give Rephy access to your Google account data without letting it know your password. Notwithstanding anything else in this Privacy Notice to the contrary, if you provide Rephy access to your Google Gmail data, Rephy’s use of that Google Gmail data will be subject to the following additional restrictions:
The Services will only use your Google OAuth for purposes of authenticating your account with us.
The Services will not transfer this OAuth data to others unless doing so is necessary (i) to provide and improve the features of the Services we provide to you, (ii) to comply with applicable law, or (iii) as part of a merger, acquisition or sale of assets.
We will not use or share this OAuth data for serving advertising, including retargeting, personalized or interest-based advertising.
We will not allow humans to read this data unless:
we have your affirmative agreement for specific messages;
doing so is necessary for security purposes (such as investigating a bug or abuse);
it is necessary to comply with applicable law; or
the data has been aggregated and anonymized and is used only for our own internal operations purposes.

Our Services’ use of information received, and the Services’ transfer of information to any other app, from Google APIs will adhere to Google’s Limited Use Requirements.

Personal Information Automatically Collected

We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect information you provide to us and information about how you access and use the Services when you visit our services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including (i) cookies or small data files that are stored on an individual’s computer and (ii) other, related technologies, such as web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, mobile SDKs, location-identifying technologies and logging technologies (collectively, “tracking technologies”) and we may use third-party partners or technologies to collect this information. Information we collect automatically about you may be combined with other personal information we collect directly from you or receive from other sources.

We, and our third-party partners, use tracking technologies to automatically collect usage and device information, such as:

Information about the computer, tablet, smartphone or other device you use, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, device type/model/manufacturer, operating system, date and time stamp, and a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device, or your account (including, for example, a persistent device identifier or an Ad ID), and other such information. We may also work with third-party partners to employ technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which permit us to recognize and contact you across multiple devices.
Information about the way you access our Services, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our services, how frequently you access the Service, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the services from multiple devices, and other browsing behavior and actions you take on the Sites.
Information about how you use the Services, such as the pages you visit, the links you click, the ads you view and click on, videos you watch, and other similar actions. We may also use third-party tools to collect information you provide to us or information about how you use the Service and may record your mouse movements, scrolling, clicks and keystroke activity on the Service and other browsing, search or purchasing behavior. These tools may also record information you enter when you interact with our Service or engage in chat features through our Service.
Information about your location, such as general geographic location that we or our third-party providers may derive from your IP address.
Analytics information. We may collect analytics data or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the services and to understand more about the demographics of our users. You can learn more about [Google’s practices](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners) and view its [opt-out options](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
All of the information collected automatically through these tools allows us to improve your user experience. For example, we may use this information to enhance and personalize your user experience, to monitor and improve our Sites and Services, and to improve the effectiveness of our Service, offers, advertising, communications and customer service. We may also use this information the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our services; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance our services.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies; however, doing so may negatively impact your experience using the services, as some features and services may not work properly. You may also set your email options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our email and performed certain functions with it.
