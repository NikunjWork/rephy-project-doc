## Feature

!!! info "Overview"

    Platform enables users to refer providers to others, helping to grow their network and facilitate valuable connections. You can share provider profiles using various methods, both on and off the platform. This feature ensures that both the sender and the receiver benefit from the referral process.

## Off-Platform Referral Options

1. Facebook:<br/>
   Share the provider's profile directly on Facebook. Your friends and followers can easily access the providerâ€™s information and make connections.

- Instagram:<br/>
  Use Instagram to refer a provider by sharing their profile link in your stories or direct messages, making it simple for your contacts to learn more.

- Email:<br/>
  Send a personalized email referral to your friends or colleagues. Include the provider's profile link, allowing them to view the provider's services directly.

- Copy Link:<br/>
  Copy the provider's profile link and share it through any messaging app or platform of your choice for greater flexibility in your outreach.

## Referral Process Off the Platform

- When a new user registers through your referral, they will automatically connect with you if you are a provider and have fewer than 25 connections. If you have more than 25 connections, auto-connection will not occur.

- As the sender, you will receive a platform notification and a message regarding the referral. This keeps you updated on your referral activities.

## On-Platform Referral Process

- To refer a provider directly within the platform, select the "Refer" option. You will then see a list of all your connected users.

- Choose the user you want to send the referral to and send them a message with the provider's profile details.

- The receiver can easily view the referred provider's profile and connect with them. They can either click the "Call" button or send a direct message to the provider. This action will increase the provider's `referral received count`, and it will also increase the sender's count of `referrals given`.

## Getting Started

- Open any `"Provider"` or `"Client"` profile.
- Click to the "Refer" option.
- Select on the platform or use one of the off-platform methods.
- Help expand your network and connect others with valuable providers.
