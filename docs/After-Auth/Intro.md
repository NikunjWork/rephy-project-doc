## Feature

!!! info "Overview"

    The Intro feature allows users to seamlessly introduce providers to their connections, fostering new opportunities and collaborations. This innovative tool simplifies the process of sharing provider profiles and enhances communication within the platform, ensuring that only connected users can facilitate introductions.

## How It Works

### Connection Check

- Before using the Intro feature, ensure that you and the provider are connected.

### Initiating the Intro

- Navigate to the provider's profile and click the "Intro" button. This will redirect you to a one-on-one chat screen.

### Adding Connections

- The selected user will receive an intro message that includes the provider's details along with options to accept or reject the introduction and also get notification.

### Provider Response

- If the recipient clicks "Accept" a group chat will be created with the selected user, provider and the introducer. The accepted user will be redirected to this newly created group chat for immediate communication.
- If the recipient clicks "Reject" the intro process will end, and no further action will be taken.
