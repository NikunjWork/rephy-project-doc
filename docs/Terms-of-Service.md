(including its successors and assigns, "Rephy," "we," "our," or "us"). By accessing and/or using the Service, or by clicking a button or checking a box marked "I Agree" (or something similar), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms, and you acknowledge that you have read and understood our [Privacy Notice](http://127.0.0.1:8000/Privacy-Policy/) , as further described in Section 8.1 (Privacy). We reserve the right to modify these Terms, and we will provide notice of material changes as described below. These Terms apply to all visitors and users of the Service, and to all others who access the Service or otherwise agree to these Terms (collectively, "Users," and, as applicable to you, "you" or "your").

Please read these terms carefully to ensure that you understand each provision. These terms contain a mandatory individual arbitration provision in Section 15.2(the "Arbitration Agreement") and a class action/jury trial waiver provision in Section 15.3(the "Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver") that require, unless you opt out pursuant to the instructions in the arbitration agreement, the exclusive use of final and binding arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes between you and us, including any claims that arose or were asserted before you agreed to these terms. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law (as defined below), you expressly waive your right to seek relief in a court of law and to have a jury trial on your claims, as well as your right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any class, collective, private attorney general, or representative action or proceeding.

1.  How We Administer the Service

1.1 Eligibility. This is a contract between you and Rephy. You must read and agree to these Terms before using the Service. If you do not agree, you may not use the Service. You may use the Service only if you can form a legally binding contract with us, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations ("Applicable Law"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any access to, or use of, the Service by anyone who is a minor (which is under the age of 18 in most jurisdictions) in any applicable jurisdiction (a "Minor") is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms, unless such access and/or use is supervised by a parent or legal guardian ("Parent") who: (a) has read and understands these Terms; (b) approves all rights granted, and all obligations undertaken, by the Minor hereunder; and (c) agrees to be bound by these Terms. If you are a Parent of a User who is a Minor, then, by allowing such Minor to access and/or use the Service, you are subject to these Terms and responsible for such Minor’s activity on the Service. With respect to the Parent of a User who is a Minor, "you," as used in these Terms in the context of a license grant, assignment, restriction, obligation, acknowledgment, representation, warranty, or covenant, or in any similar context, means "the Parent, on behalf of the Parent and the Minor," and "your" has the corresponding meaning. The Service is not available to any Users we previously removed from the Service.

1.2 User Accounts

(a) Your User Account. Your account on the Service (your "User Account") gives you access to certain services and functionalities that we may, in our sole discretion, establish and maintain as part of the Service from time to time. You acknowledge that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you do not own your User Account, nor do you possess any rights to data stored by or on behalf of Rephy on the servers running the Service. We may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of Users.

(b) Connecting Via Third-Party Services. By connecting to the Service via a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service, as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials and/or access tokens for that service.

When creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your User Account, you will keep your User Account password(s) and/or any other authentication credentials secure, and you will not share your password(s) and/or any other authentication credentials with anyone else. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and symbols) to protect your User Account. You will notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your User Account.

(d) Account Settings. You may control certain aspects of your User Account and any associated User profile, and of the way you interact with the Service, by changing the settings in your settings page.

We may also use that email address to send you other messages, including, without limitation, marketing and advertising messages, such as messages notifying you of changes to features of the Service and special offers (collectively, "Marketing Emails"). If you do not want to receive Marketing Emails, you may opt out of receiving them or change your preferences by contacting the Service support team at legal@rephy.com or by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link within a Marketing Email.

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through the service will create any warranty not expressly stated herein.

United states federal law and some states, provinces, and other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of and/or limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above exclusions and/or limitations may not apply to you. These terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations under these terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

14. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will any REPHY indemnitee be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data, or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the service or any portion thereof.

This limitation of liability section applies whether the alleged liability is based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other basis, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damage.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of and/or limitations on incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions and/or limitations may not apply to you. These terms give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability under these terms will not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.

15. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver

15.1 Governing Law.You agree that:(a) the Service will be deemed solely based in the State of Delaware; and (b) the Service will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Delaware. These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law governing these Terms, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) (as it may be amended, "FAA") governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement below and preempts all state laws (and laws of other jurisdictions) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. If the FAA is found to not apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue will be resolved under and governed by the law of the U.S. state where you live (if applicable) or the jurisdiction mutually agreed upon in writing by you and us. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Delaware for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Confidential Information, or Intellectual Property Rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that Delaware is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award, or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration Agreement below is found to be unenforceable. These Terms were drafted in the English language and this English language version of the Terms is the original, governing instrument of the understanding between you and us. In the event of any conflict between the English version of these Terms and any translation, the English version will prevail.

15.2 Arbitration Agreement

(a) General. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.This Arbitration Agreement applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (i) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, and enforceability thereof; (ii) access to or use of the Service, including receipt of any advertising or marketing communications; (iii) any transactions through, by, or using the Service; or (iv) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a User or consumer (each, a "Claim," and, collectively, "Claims"). This Arbitration Agreement will apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms.

(b) Opting Out of Arbitration Agreement. If you are a new User, you can reject and opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within thirty (30) days of accepting these Terms by emailing us at legal@rephy.com with your full, legal name and stating your intent to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement does not affect the binding nature of any other part of these Terms, including the provisions regarding controlling law or the courts in which any disputes must be brought.

(c) Dispute-Resolution Process. For any Claim, you will first contact us at legal@rephy.com and attempt to resolve the Claim with us informally. In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a Claim after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve such Claim exclusively through binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator (the "Arbitrator"), under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS (the "Rules"), except as provided herein. JAMS may be contacted at www.jamsadr.com, where the Rules are available. In the event of any conflict between the Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement will control. The arbitration will be conducted in the U.S. County where you live (if applicable) or Kent County, Delaware, unless you and Rephy agree otherwise. If you are using the Service for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing and administrative fees and Arbitrator fees in accordance with the Rules, and the award rendered by the Arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using the Service for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the Arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorneys’ fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this would not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that the Arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator will also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are, or whether any provision of these Terms is, unconscionable or illusory, and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, unconscionability, and/or estoppel.

(d) Equitable Relief. Nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed as: preventing us from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, confidential information, or intellectual property rights; or preventing you from asserting claims in a small claims court, provided that your claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances on only an individual (non-class, non-collective, and non-representative) basis.

(e) Severability. If this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will be severed. Severance of the void, unenforceable, or unlawful provision, in whole or in part, will have no impact on the remaining provisions of this Arbitration Agreement, which will remain in force, or on the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining Claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver below is found to be void, unenforceable, or unlawful, in whole or in part, because it would prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief, then any dispute regarding the entitlement to such relief (and only that relief) must be severed from arbitration and may be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction. All other claims for relief subject to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement will be arbitrated under its terms, and the parties agree that litigation of any dispute regarding the entitlement to public injunctive relief will be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

15.3 Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver. by entering into these terms, you and REPHY are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to bring, join, or participate in any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding of any kind as a plaintiff or class member. the foregoing applies to all users (both natual persons and entities), regardless of whether you have obtained or used the service for personal, commercial, or other purposes. This class action/jury trial waiver applies to class arbitration, and, unless we agree otherwise, the Arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s or entity’s claims. You and REPHY agree that the Arbitrator may award relief only to an individual claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief on your individual claim(s). Any relief awarded may not affect other users.
